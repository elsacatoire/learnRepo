# Docker Learning Journey

Welcome to the Docker learning section of my repository! üê≥ In this directory, I've documented my adventures in learning and mastering Docker, an essential tool for containerization in modern development environments.

## What's Inside

### Projects

- **Project 1**: A simple Dockerized Java application.
- **Project 2**: 

Feel free to explore each project folder to dive into the code and the steps taken to containerize these applications.

## Docker Commands

For quick reference, here are some common Docker commands that I've found useful:

```bash
# Build a Docker image
docker build -t image-name .

# Run a Docker container
docker run -p 8080:80 image-name

# List running containers
docker ps

# Stop a running container
docker stop container-id
